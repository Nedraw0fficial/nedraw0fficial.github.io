            <p>
                So we've got eight planets in our solar system, and they're all pretty different from each other.
                Mercury's close to the Sun and moves fast, Neptune's way out there and freezing cold.
                Each one's got its own thing going on. Here's the rundown:

            <h3>BONUS LEVELS: DWARF PLANETS</h3>
            <p>
                Past Neptune, there's a bunch of dwarf planets floating around - Pluto's the famous
                one, but there's also Eris, Ceres, and others. They're smaller than regular planets
                but still interesting. Out there you've also got the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud,
                which are basically huge areas full of icy rocks and comets that we're still learning about.
