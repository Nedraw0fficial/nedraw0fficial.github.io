            <h3>THE APOLLO LEGACY</h3>
            <p>
                The Apollo program was like the ultimate boss level of space exploration. Between 1969 and 1972, twelve 
                astronauts walked on the Moon, collecting samples, conducting experiments, and proving that humanity could 
                reach beyond our planet. It was the greatest multiplayer co-op mission ever attempted!
            </p>

            <p>
                The tech innovations from Apollo were game-changing. Computer systems, communications, life support - all 
                these got massive upgrades that still influence how we design spacecraft today. It's like the original 
                developers created the foundation for all future space missions.
            </p>

            <h3>NEXT LEVEL: ARTEMIS</h3>
            <p>
                Today, NASA's Artemis program is loading the next chapter. The goal? Return humans to the Moon and 
                eventually reach Mars. It's like a New Game+ mode with better graphics, improved AI, and expanded 
                multiplayer features. The game isn't over - we're just getting started!
