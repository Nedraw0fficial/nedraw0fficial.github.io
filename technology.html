            <p>
                Space technology is like collecting the most epic power-ups in the game. Every innovation makes our 
                spacecraft faster, stronger, and more capable. From reusable rockets to AI-powered rovers, these tech 
                upgrades are changing how we explore the cosmos. Time to check out the ultimate gear!

            <h3>EQUIPMENT INVENTORY</h3>
            <p>
                Modern space tech is absolutely insane! Reusable rockets are like having unlimited continues - SpaceX 
                lands boosters and launches them again, cutting costs dramatically. Ion drives give spacecraft the 
                efficiency boost they need for long journeys. Advanced robotics let us explore dangerous areas without 
                risking player characters, and AI systems make spacecraft smart enough to handle problems billions of 
                miles from home base.

            <h3>TECH TREE: EARTHSIDE UPGRADES</h3>
            <p>
                Many technologies developed for space have spawned amazing upgrades for Earth! Memory foam was originally 
                created for spacecraft seats - now it's in mattresses and medical equipment everywhere. Water purification 
                systems designed for the International Space Station help provide clean water in remote locations. GPS, 
                weather satellites, and global communications are all side quests that became essential to daily life.
            </p>

            <p>
                Looking ahead, the tech being developed for Mars colonization is going to be game-changing. Advanced 3D 
                printing can build structures from local materials, closed-loop life support systems recycle everything, 
                and in-situ resource utilization means creating fuel and oxygen from Martian resources. These innovations 
                will level up life on Earth too, helping with sustainable construction, resource conservation, and living 
                in extreme environments.

            <h3>CHEAT CODES FROM SPACE</h3>
            <p>
                Space exploration has given us some incredible "cheat codes" for everyday technology. Satellite imagery 
                helps farmers optimize crops, disaster response teams coordinate rescues, and scientists track climate 
                change. Miniaturized electronics from spacecraft made smartphones possible. Even the technology in your 
                pocket has space DNA - thank you, NASA!
