            <h2>LEVEL UP YOUR KNOWLEDGE</h2>
            <p>
                Space tech has gotten pretty wild over the years. We've gone from basic rockets that blow up half 
                the time to reusable ones that land themselves, plus AI-powered rovers that can drive around Mars 
                on their own. Every new piece of tech makes exploring space a bit easier and cheaper. Here's some 
                of the cool stuff we're working with now.
            </p>

            <h3>EQUIPMENT INVENTORY</h3>
            <p>
                The tech we use for space now is honestly pretty impressive. SpaceX figured out how to land rockets 
                and use them again, which saves a ton of money. Ion engines are super efficient for long trips. We've 
                got robots that can go places too dangerous for humans, and spacecraft with AI that can solve problems 
                on their own when they're too far away for us to help in real time.

            <p>Check out this video about some of the new tech being developed:</p>

            <h3>TECH TREE: EARTHSIDE UPGRADES</h3>
            <p>
                A lot of stuff we invented for space ended up being useful on Earth too. Memory foam was made for 
                astronaut seats originally, and now it's in mattresses everywhere. The water filters on the ISS 
                helped develop better purification systems for places without clean water. And obviously GPS, weather 
                satellites, and global communications all came from space programs.
            </p>

            <p>
                The tech they're developing for Mars missions is going to be useful here too. 3D printers that can 
                build stuff using local materials, life support systems that recycle everything, machines that can 
                make fuel and oxygen from whatever's around - all of that could help with sustainable building and 
                living in tough environments on Earth.
            </p>

            <h3>CHEAT CODES FROM SPACE</h3>
            <p>
                Space tech has made a lot of everyday things possible. Farmers use satellite images to manage their 
                crops better, rescue teams use them to coordinate during disasters, scientists track climate change 
                with them. The tiny electronics in spacecraft led to smartphones being possible. So yeah, a lot of 
                the tech in your phone exists because of space exploration.
